# Propeller ASM
Propeller with 5 LEDs in vertical strip rotated to form a text.
This project is in Partial Fulfillment of the requirements for the degree in Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering.
Group Project by: ðŸŒŸ`Jan Tan`, `Jay Villalon`, `Dante Wong de Lumen`, `Hugh Segovia`, `John Ombi-on`

## Major Components
- PIC16f84A
###### 8-bit microcontroller used to program the sequence of LEDs
- Motor
###### Used as the base of our propeller
- Hall Effect Sensor
###### Used in the project for timing the sequence of our LEDs

## Programming
###### Integrated the use of Interrupt Routine to time the sequence of our LEDs with the help of Hall Effect Sensor. Programmed the LEDs with two type of delays (delay for each vertical pixel of the word, and a Kerning delay after each letter.
